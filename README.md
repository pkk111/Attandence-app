# Attandence-app

**Version 1.2.0**

This app is to take attendence during class and is made in android studios.

It works on the wifi-hotspot feature on android devices.

It ensures that one student can only mark one attendence as the teacher's side app keeps the record of the ip address of the phones who are requesting to mark attendence.

This app can also be used to take attendence at various other organisations and companies.
